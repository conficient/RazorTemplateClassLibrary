RazorTemplateClassLibrary
=========================

Demonstrates amendments to C# class library to enable IDE support for Razor templates.

If you wish to create, edit and use Razor .cshtml (or .vbhtml) format documents outside of an ASP.NET 
web application, it is possible. This project shows the steps required to make it happen.

This library should be used in combination with my blog post [ASP.NET Razor Views in Class Libraries](http://conficient.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/asp-net-razor-views-in-class-libraries/) on Wordpress.

I plan to create a commit at each set of changes, so you can see the finished product in the latest release and step back though each commit to see the changes made.
